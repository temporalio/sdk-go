# Temporal Go SDK [![Build Status](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?event=push)](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![PkgGoDev](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/go.temporal.io/sdk)](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk)

[Temporal](https://github.com/temporalio/temporal) is a distributed, scalable, durable, and highly available orchestration engine used to execute asynchronous long-running business logic in a scalable and resilient way.

"Temporal Go SDK" is the framework for authoring workflows and activities using Go language.

## How to use

Clone this repo into the preferred location.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go.git
```

See [samples](https://github.com/temporalio/samples-go) to get started.

Documentation is available [here](https://docs.temporal.io). 
You can also find the API documentation [here](https://pkg.go.dev/go.temporal.io/sdk).

## Using slog

If using Go version 1.21+ the Go SDK provides built in integration with the standard [slog](https://pkg.go.dev/log) package.


```go
package main
import (
	"log/slog"
	"os"

	"go.temporal.io/sdk/client"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/log"
	"go.temporal.io/sdk/worker"
)

func main() {
	clientOptions := client.Options{
		Logger: log.NewStructuredLogger(
			slog.New(slog.NewJSONHandler(os.Stdout, &slog.HandlerOptions{
				AddSource: true,
				Level:     slog.LevelDebug,
			}))),
	}
	temporalClient, err := client.Dial(clientOptions)
	// ...
}
```

## Workflow determinism checker

See [contrib/tools/workflowcheck](contrib/tools/workflowcheck) for a tool to detect non-determinism in Workflow Definitions.

We'd love your help in making the Temporal Go SDK great. Please review our [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Go build and run tags

Prior to SDK version v1.26.0 our protobuf code generator allowed invalid UTF-8 data to be stored as proto strings. This isn't actually allowed by the proto3 spec, so if you're using our SDK and think you may store arbitrary binary data in our strings you should set `-tags protolegacy` when building against our SDK.

Example:

``` shell
$ go build -tags protolegacy myworker/main.go
```

If you see an error like `grpc: error unmarshalling request: string field contains invalid UTF-8` then you will need to enable this when building your code.

If you're unsure then you should specify it anyways as there's no harm in doing so unless you relied on the protobuf compiler to ensure all strings were valid UTF-8.
