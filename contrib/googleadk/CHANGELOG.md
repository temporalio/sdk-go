# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added

- `NewPlugin` wires the integration as a worker plugin: add it to `worker.Options.Plugins`
  to register the `InvokeModel` / `ListMcpTools` / `CallMcpTool` Activities at worker start
  and close cached MCP toolsets at worker stop. `NewActivities` + `Register` remain for the
  test environments (which do not run plugins) and manual wiring.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Added the `contrib/googleadk` package, which makes Google ADK (`adk-go`) agents durable and
  replay-safe under Temporal.
